# Random personal projects
This is just a hodgepodge of simple programs: a place for weekend projects :)  

### Roomba's virtual barrier for Arduino (with Javier Torres https://github.com/javitonino)
We programmed the barrier with an Arduino uno, an infrarred LED and a 120 Ohm resistor. Tested at home with our Roomba and it worked.


### Simple Chronometer with Python
I just wanted a chronometer with a simple interface, so I tried searching Ubuntu's repos.
Tired of wasting time with broken dependencies, I decided my time was best spent
programming my own chrono. This is a working (quite ugly) first version that needs
tons of improvement.
